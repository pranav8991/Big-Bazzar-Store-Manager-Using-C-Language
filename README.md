# Big-Bazzar-Store-Manager-Using-Cpp-Language 🛒

Ah, yet another project where the ambition far exceeded the original scope! 🏔️ What started as a simple store management system quickly spiraled into something much, much larger. And by "larger," I mean full of twists, turns, and plenty of unnecessary details (but hey, that's how we learn, right?). This little gem is from my second semester, where I had to manage a store in code—because apparently, running one in real life wasn't enough of a challenge. 😅

### The "Big" Concept:
Welcome to **Big Bazzar**, the Walmart-like store in the world of C++ code. The idea is simple: 
- **Customers** can search for stores nearby and browse items.
- **Managers** can add items, set quantities, determine prices, apply discounts, and sell goods.

In short, it's your one-stop shop for simulating the hustle and bustle of store management, right from your terminal. 📟

### Key Features
Here's what you'll find in this "store management" adventure:
- **Customer Mode**: You’re a customer? Great! Just browse through the available stores and products.
- **Manager Mode**: You’re the boss? Add items, set quantities, manage pricing, and apply discounts like a pro!
- **Decorative Console Output**: Because, who doesn’t love a little ASCII art and fancy outputs? (I might’ve gone overboard here.)

### Compiling This "Masterpiece"
Ready to run your own Big Bazzar? Here’s how you do it:
```bash
g++ -o store_manager proj.cpp
```

### Running the Program
Once compiled, you can enter your virtual store with:
```bash
./store_manager
```

### Output Example:
You'll be greeted with a beautiful, welcoming display. Here’s a sneak peek:
```

*  ****WELCOME TO THE BIG BAZZAR****                       *
*  ****                                                   *
***********************************************************
```

### A Final Note:
This project was the ultimate coding playground, a place where I pushed the limits of my (then) coding skills. You may find an array of `cout` statements, unnecessary ASCII art, and over-engineered features, but isn’t that what coding is all about? 😎

Now, go ahead, dive into **Big Bazzar**, and enjoy managing your own store—one line of code at a time!
